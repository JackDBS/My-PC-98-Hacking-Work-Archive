Something's not right at the prestigious Amamiya Private School.  For
years, the Amamiya family has overseen the institution, working hard
to help girls mature into refined young ladies.  But now the students
are disappearing.  Perhaps they're just running away; with all the
pressure placed upon them here, it could be possible...

However, its up to the JES to find out what's really going on at the
school.  This organization is in charge of running investigations
within private schools; in fact, several of its agents have already
gone undercover at the school.  All are now missing.  Yuichi Sakuma is
the JES's latest plant.  Will he be able to discover the reason for
the turmoil at Amamiya Private School, or will he end up just like the
others?

Love Potion is a menu-driven adventure game.  You play from Yuichi's
perspective, leading him in his investigation.  Your main duty will be
to guide Yuichi aroundt the school, looking in all the right places
for clues to unravel the mystery.  Exactly what is going on at this
posh private girls' school?  Play to find out!

Yuichi Sakuma
-------------
I don't really know what Sakuma's superiors at the JES were thinking
when giving him this assignment.  Sure, he's a sharp enough
investigator, but he really just can't seem to control himself around
the opposite sex.  In his current situation, where its not apparent
who's trustworthy, Yuichi's weakness could mean his downfall.

Toshiko Amamiya
---------------
Ms. Amamiya is the principal of the school which bears her family
name.  She carries herself in a professional manner, bordering on
uptight, but her demeanor is smoothed by a graceful air.  Her youthful
appearance makes it hard to believe she has a daughter old enough to
attend the school.

Megumi Sasaki
-------------
Agent Sasaki was Yuichi's immediate predecessor at the Amamiya
School.  The fact that this capable agent suddenly disappeared means
the situation at the school may be deadly serious.

Hiromi Matsuno
--------------
Hiromi is cute, energetic, and generally happy.  She's usually enjoys
talking with Yuichi, but at times it seems as if she's troubled.  Will
this student be able to trust and confide in him?

Sayuri Amamiya
--------------
Sayuri is the model daughter and student.  She's at the top of her
class, the student body president, and basically the pentultimate
model for everyone at the school.  Can she really be so perfect?

Yumiko Mizukami
---------------
Yumiko may have a great body, but it's a total mismatch to her boyish
personality.  She openly displays her hostility towards Professor
Sakuma.  Does that mean she has something to hide?

Yoko Kawano
-----------
Yoko doesn't seem to have a personality of her own; she's basically
Sayuri's lackey, going to great lengths to please the girl.

Noriko Furima
-------------
Noriko is just a first year student at the school, so she's not in
Yuichi's class.  She's always active in the gym after school, although
she doesn't seem to belong to any particular club.  Talking to her can
be infuriating, as she's somewhat immature and always silly.

Shizuka Iijima
--------------
Ms. Iijima is the school nurse, and like any good bishoujo game nurse,
she's sexy as hell and not afraid to show it.  Everytime she sees
Yuichi, she just can't control herself.  Whether that's good or bad is
up to personal opinion.

Kyoko Himura
------------
This student seems to be a quiet loner.  Yuichi sometimes catches her
staring at him, and he never sees her with other girls.  Her
intentions are unknown, maybe she just has a crush on him?

                              iv. WALKTHROUGH  
=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-==-==-=-==-=-===--=

Love Potion is a strictly linear game.  You can't lose, and none of
the decisions you make affect the outcome of the story.  Basically,
your purpose is to guide "Professor" Sakuma around the school,
triggering the requisite events to move the story along.  

Why do you need a walkthrough, then?  Easy, you don't.  In fact, its
probably more fun playing through the game by yourself, not knowing
what's going to happen next.  I would heartily recommend playing that
way, and I can understand if no one ever uses this walkthrough.

However,  just because the game is linear doesn't mean its not
frustrating.  You can spend minutes going to the different locations
in the school, swearing that you've done everything possible to move
the action along, and nothing happens.  This guide attempts to keep
those situations to a minimum, telling you where to go and what choices
you need to make in order to advance the plot.  It leaves out any
extraneous action, so if you want to read all the innocuous minutia
the game offers, do that before fulfilling the requirements for
advancement.

So, if you're playing through the game for a fifth time and want to
move quickly, or you have a short attention span, or you're just plain
lazy or impatient; you should find this document useful.
