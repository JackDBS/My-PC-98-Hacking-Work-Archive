Etsuraku no Gakuen Backport
By WINE
Version 1.2

These patches will insert the script and the uncensored graphics of the English 1999 Himeya Soft localization of "Love Potion" into the original 1994 Japanese floppy disk hard drive version. The script has gone through a few typo changes, but it's mostly intact.
The title screen in the opening is animated, so it's not translated. Sorry.
If you need it, or want to cut out all the tedium, there's an old guide from IGN that I stole shamelessly. Thank you! As the walkthrough file said "Any other site or publication posting it has ripped this FAQ. React according to your own moral standards."
The OPNA Version of the soundtrack will not be added in the future as it doesn't play any audio.

HOW TO APPLY THE PATCH:

1. Download "Etsuraku no Gakuen (FD version) [HD]" from Neo Kobe.
2. Use an XDelta patcher to apply the patch on the Neo Kobe "Etsuraku no Gakuen (FD version) [HD]".
3. Name it whatever you want.
4. Enjoy!

BUGS:
	After you make a choice, sometimes part of that white line will still be on screen. It's not game breaking.
