yYuichiz It's dark in here.
It was very dark in there and there was no light at all. I couldn't see 5 inches ahead of myself.
yYuichiz In this darkness, I won't be able to... Woops...
I tripped on something and hit something with my face.
It was soft...
yYuichiz Um, what is this.
It is soft and smells good. I caressed it.
It was soft.
yYuichiz Hey Kyouko, there is something strange here.
Something hard hit me in the stomach.
POW!
yKyoukoz That's me, you idiot?
I heard her voice above me. The strange thing was her butt.
yYuichiz I can't help it. But, wow, it smelled so nice.
yKyoukoz Do you want me to hit you again?
yYuichiz Oh no, I tripped on something on the floor, and... Hmm...
What is this? Chains?
yKyoukoz What is it?
yYuichiz Well, this is...
yKyoukoz What?
Kyouko grabbed the knob in front of me, and threw open the door..

Shit!
yWoman's Voicez You're finally here, you little tight-assed spies.
yKyoukoz Toshiko Amamiya.
yYuichiz Megumi!
There was the president Toshiko Amamiya lying with Megumi Sasaki.
yKyoukoz What an act!
Toshiko was wearing a black rubber suit with her boobs sticking out.
Her heels were 10cm high, and they were the same color as her suit.
It was all an act.
yToshikoz I watched what you guys were doing from this monitor.
Besides Toshiko was a monitor that could see the president's room even in the dark.
yKyoukoz In that case, I wished you had left the bookshelf open.
yToshikoz I was curious how you operated. You think like a monkey.
@Talk to Toshiko Amamiya@@
@Look at Megumi Sasaki
@Look around
Megumi was not hearing me.
Megumi was wearing a dark red colored rubber suit. She was right next to Toshiko.
She looked at me with dead eyes.
yYuichiz Megumi!
yMegumiz ...
yToshikoz It's useless, she can't hear you at all.
She did not seem to hear my voice. She licked Toshiko's body and masturbated.
This room was a torture room.
Black stains ran down the walls. I didn't want to imagine what that was.
Various instruments and tools used for torture lay against the wall.
Toshiko got up and lifted Megumi's chin with her index finger and showed it to us.
650
yToshikoz At first, she didn't want to. But now she enjoys it.
yYuichiz What?
I was mad.
yToshikoz This girl is a sex slave. She can't go back. Well, enough with the chit chat.
Toshiko looked behind us.. Behind us!?
660
yYuichiz Fuck!
Sayuri was holding a gun. It was pointed at us.
yToshikoz What took you so long. Well, it's alright. Just don't kill the girl. We can use a cute girl.
Toshiko stood up and looked at us.
yToshikoz There will be no evidence.
Sayuri was holding the gun on us, but her face was filled with confusion.
yToshikoz What are you doing? Shoot, Sayuri!
Sayuri's hand was shaking, and she opened her mouth to say something.
660b
ySayuriz Professor Sakuma. Will you come to our side?
We were not the only ones surprised by this. Her mother was surprised and angry.
yToshikoz What are you talking about Sayuri?
ySayuriz Shut up, mother.
yToshikoz What has gotten into you, Sayuri?
Sayuri ignored her mother. She looked into my eyes and asked me again.
ySayuriz So, what's it gonna be?
yYuichiz No thanks.
ySayuriz Are you sure?
yToshikoz Shoot him, Sayuri.
ySayuriz Shut up! Please Yuichi, come with me and...
She was talking to me tenderly.
Kyouko interrupted her.
yKyoukoz Sayuri, we want to help you. Stop this so we can help you.
Kyouko whispered to me "let me handle this".
yYuichiz Hey...
She walked towards Sayuri.
yKyoukoz Here, give me the gun. Help us. Let us help you.
ySayuriz Don't come near me!
I felt a premonition of disaster.
yKyoukoz This is for you too, Sayuri.
ySayuriz Don't come!
yYuichiz Look out, Kyouko!
665
jyu
BAM!
yKyoukoz Uh!
The bullet hit Kyouko in the shoulder. She spun as if dancing, and fell like a stick.

670
yYuichiz Kyouko, are you okay...
yKyoukoz Uuuuu....
Blood poured from her shoulder and ran down her clothes. Kyouko started to shake.
yToshikoz Good job, Sayuri. Now, shoot professor Sakuma.
Sayuri didn't hear her mother's voice. All she did was look at the gun and Kyouko.
665
665b
ySayuriz It's her fault. I told her to stop. Yuichi, come with me.
yYuichiz ...
ySayuriz Do you want me to pull the trigger?
yYuichiz Shoot if you want!
ySayuriz You don't think I can? I'm not kidding, I'll shoot.
She was serious.
Sayuri walked towards me. Her face was tense, and I could even see tears in her eyes.
ySayuriz Please, just say you'll come with me! Please!
Sayuri wasn't asking anymore; she was begging.
If I said "yes", she wouldn't shoot.
But I didn't.
yYuichiz No.
Her face showed surprise and desperation.
The finger squeezed the trigger. I was prepared to die.
yMegumiz No!
680
Megumi was the white knight coming to the rescue.
She grabbed Sayuri's hand. They fought for control.
jyu
BAM!
I ducked as the gunshot rang out.
I checked my body. No bullet holes.
I heard something fall down to the floor and groan.

id62
yToshikoz No, why...
The bullet had hit Toshiko.
Toshiko's face was filled with confusion and pain.
ySayuriz Oh no, it can't be... Mother...
Sayuri sat on the floor as if mad. Her eyes grew unfocused. I watched her with compassion.
yMegumiz Yuichi, Yuichi!!!
700
yMegumiz Yuichi, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
yYuichiz Megumi...
Megumi was crying on my chest. This tough woman's face was covered with tears.
I was sad and confused.
yKyoukoz Can I ask you one thing?
yToshikoz What is it?
Kyouko spoke. Toshiko moved her eyes to Kyouko.
yKyoukoz How did you know there was more than one agent?
yToshikoz Oh, that.
Toshiko smiled as if to say, it was too late... The edge of her lips twisted in pain.
yToshikoz People from your organization come to the parties.
"You probably didn't know".
yKyoukoz ... I see.
Kyouko was nodding. What a mess. It is everywhere.
yToshikoz They are the leaders. And we were their sex objects.
yYuichiz Where are the students now?
yToshikoz Some have stayed with them.
Toshiko looked at me and smiled a little.
630
yToshikoz They are love slaves.
yYuichiz Love slaves?
yToshikoz Yes. Our leader's love slaves.
640
yToshikoz They will never be found. They will live out their lives as love slaves, devoting themselves to their master.
I said nothing. My brows contracted.
yToshikoz You're cute when you're mad.
Toshiko was enjoying it, even though she was dying.
620
yYuichiz You know people's weaknesses. You are like a cult leader.
yToshikoz You see it as evil. I see it as giving love to the world. For both the girl and the master.
yYuichiz Right.
I curled my hand into a fist and walked towards Toshiko. Kyouko stopped me.
I couldn't control myself.
yYuichiz I want you to tell me one thing.
yToshikoz Sure.
yYuichiz What were you doing?
I asked Toshiko, but Kyouko answered.
yKyoukoz Our mission is to educate students.
yToshikoz Yes. To provide well trained girls to the top people in Japan.
yKyoukoz You are so naive.
yYuichiz ...
Toshiko was smiling. There was no remorse.
yToshikoz We are here because people need it.
yYuichiz Need?
Toshiko touched Megumi's hair with her fingers. She smiled and went on.
yToshikoz Do you not have needs? The need to love. The need to be loved. People think if they act normal they will be loved. That doesn't bring love.
yYuichiz ...
yToshikoz We taught love. Or, perhaps a better word, devotion.
yYuichiz So?
yToshikoz You don't know love. Have you ever seen another as a god? That is love.
I stared at Toshiko. In that room she made sense.
yYuichiz You are wrong.
Toshiko smiled. No. Artists are seldom understood. And we are artists.
yKyoukoz This is it, Toshiko. JES knows everything.
yToshikoz So, you're Kyouko. You were a student, right? How silly of me to not notice you.
Toshiko was caressing Megumi's hair gently. She was not angry. "You think the world will change?" she asked.

A few days later...
Some of the truth became public. But not all.
The mystery was solved. I was done.
Sayuri Amamiya and Yoko Kawano were sent away. I don't know where.
They haven't found the missing students. Maybe what Toshiko was saying was true.
But there is nothing more that I can do now.
yHiromiz Professor, what's wrong?

010d
yYuichiz Oh, I was just thinking of something.
yHiromiz A serious face does not suit you, professor.
yYuichiz Don't say that. I'm naive, you know.
Hiromi is standing near me. I am leaving the school.
@Look at Hiromi Matsuno@@
@Talk to Hiromi Matsuno@
Hiromi is smiling at me.
I feel the urge to hold her. I shouldn't.
A letter? About why she acts shy. She knows how to please me.
Hiromi is looking at me. There is a strange expression in her eyes.
The way she fixed her hair. She is cute. She is really cute.
yYuichiz I want to hold you!
yHiromiz What?
yYuichiz Oh, nothing...
What am I doing. Look, Hiromi is laughing.
yYuichiz Ignore what I just said, okay...
yHiromiz You're such a pervert.
Her feelings are not hurt.
Hiromi has recovered. She is so strong. I'm so proud of her.
On that roof top...
...
...
When I think of the little incident on the roof, I still blush. I still can't look straight into her face.
yHiromiz What's wrong?
yYuichiz Um, well, nothing... You're cute, Hiromi.
yHiromiz Oh, stop...
Did I say that? I can't believe it. Hiromi turned red.
yHiromiz Professor...
710
She came closer to me. God, she looks cute.
yYuichiz You can call me Yuichi.
yHiromiz Yuichi, thank you, and I...
Hiromi looked down and started to shake her shoulders. Is she crying? Oh no...
yYuichiz Come on, no crying okay. Hiromi... Hiromi?
I leaned down to see her face.
720
yYuichiz Damn!
I felt her lips on mine.
Hiromi stepped back.
710
yHiromiz I've always wanted to kiss you.
Hiromi said it with embarrassment. It was a new experience.
I heard a car sound its horn.
yYuichiz What is it?
Now, the sound of an engine...
yHiromiz Yuichi.
yYuichiz What?
Her face turned serious. I turned serious as well.
yHiromiz Um, Ms. Sasaki, what happened to Ms. Sasaki?
She doesn't know. I tried to speak with as much optimism as possible.
yYuichiz She's okay. There is nothing wrong with her body.
I wasn't lying. But Megumi's mind had changed....
yHiromiz Oh really...
Hiromi's face turned a little brighter. Happiness based on a lie is still happiness.
yHiromiz Read this later, okay.
yHiromiz Professor.
yYuichiz I'm not a professor anymore.
I'm not a professor at Amamiya anymore. But I do have another post at another school.
yHiromiz Here you go, Yuichi.
Hiromi handed me a folded piece of paper. There were words scribbled on it. It must be a letter.
yHiromiz I'll get embarrassed, so please read it later.
yYuichiz Thank you.
My heart started to pound.
740
yMegumiz Look at your face, Yuichi.
yYuichiz Megumi, are you okay?
yHiromiz Professor Sasaki!
There were two good looking chicks in the red convertible. One was Megumi and the other was Kyouko.
Kyouko introduced herself to Hiromi. This is the first time they met.
yMegumiz How are you doing, Ms. Matsuno?
yHiromiz Fine thank you. Am I glad you're okay, professor Sasaki.
Hiromi was crying. Her face was filled with relief and guilt.
yMegumiz Did Yuichi, I mean Mr. Sakuma do anything strange to you?
yHiromiz Strange?
yMegumiz If he ever does anything to you, punch him out okay. He has really quick hands.
yYuichiz What are you talking about.
yMegumiz It's the truth.
yHiromiz That's funny.
Hiromi is laughing out loud. It's hard to believe she was crying a minute ago.
Megumi winked at me. Thanks Megumi.
010
010d
yHiromiz Well, I better get going now.
yYuichiz Right.
yMegumiz See you again Ms. Matsuno.
yHiromiz Yes, professor Sasaki... Yuichi, I'll see you again right?
yYuichiz Of course, oh, but don't call me, because I'm never home. The best thing for you to do is to write.
yHiromiz Yes, I know that. Good luck with your work.
010
Haa, she's so cute.
yMegumiz Yuichi, just look at your perverted face.
740
yYuichiz Hey, what do you mean by a perverted face. By the way, what was that thing you were saying about me back then.
yMegumiz I was telling the truth.
yKyoukoz I think so too.
Kyouko, who was sitting to the side, nodded seriously. These two...
@Look at Megumi Sasaki and Kyouko Himuro@@
@Talk to both of them
Kyouko and Megumi are looking at each other.
They are behaving like they are.... ready to go...
yMegumiz Did you say something?
yYuichiz Oh no, I was just saying how the two of you are so beautiful.
yMegumiz What are you talking about, of course we are.
yYuichiz ...
It was a miracle how well Kyouko's shoulder wound had healed.
The bullet had missed the bone and went through her arm.
She has her hair down today. That makes her look more like a woman.
The two were the opposite of each other. The calm and quiet Kyouko and the hot Megumi.
Megumi's wound was mental, but she did not show it...
She wore loud clothing and make up. She was shamelessly showing off.
yYuichiz Well, that's okay... I still have my boss. She is an adult. I plan on getting together with her today or tomorrow...
I swallowed the name of the game I planned to play with her. But I was smiling with lust.
yMegumiz What are you smiling about? You're thinking something kinky aren't you.
yKyoukoz I thought the boss was on vacation...
yMegumiz Yes, indeed. She is taking a vacation and is in Australia. She won't be back for a while.
yYuichiz What!
They both laughed.
yYuichiz Well, I guess I'll wait for her to come back...
They laughed again.
yMegumiz I am so jealous. Going to Australia with a boyfriend...
yKyoukoz It is their prenuptial vacation.
yYuichiz What!
My boss, getting married!?
yMegumiz Oh, you didn't know?
No. It was a complete TKO.
yMegumiz Well, we'll be going now.
She stepped on the gas to indicate their departure.
yYuichiz What about me?
I finally got the nerve to say it.
yMegumiz Oh, I'm sorry. This car can only fit two people. Anyways, you don't have impressive legs.
She handed something to Kyouko.
yKyoukoz Here you go.
Kyouko handed me a letter.
yYuichiz What is this?
yMegumiz It's your next assignment.
The car sped off...
As soon as I caught the letter, they rushed away.
010
The bright sunlight shined on me.
I have no way to go home. No boss. All I have is the next assignment.
But, the next assignment. It is a reason to live.
yMegumiz But Kyouko, you look much younger than me. I'm impressed....
yYuichiz Oh. You're right, she looks like a hunky little kid.
yKyoukoz Megumi, you are still young. A college girl might work.
yYuichiz It's not going to work. Think about common sense.
yMegumiz Oh no.
yKyoukoz Uh-huh.
yYuichiz Listen to me!
yMegumiz Oh, my God, what's wrong Yuichi?
yYuichiz Ugh.
yYuichiz To tell you the truth, I don't think you two should be working as investigators for JES. JES must really be having human resource problems.
I said it while staring at Kyouko. They looked at each other in surprise.
yKyoukoz Thank you for thinking of me as young.
Kyouko said it with a happy expression.
yYuichiz What?
yMegumiz Yuichi, did you know that Kyouko is two years older than we are?
yYuichiz Are you serious!
I can't tell people's ages anymore?
I had thought she looked too sexy to be a high school student.
yYuichiz Boy, you look younger than you are.
yKyoukoz Thank you.
I almost shouted out "She's still a bitch" but I kept my mouth shut.
yMegumiz That's too bad. I should've kept quiet.
Kyouko and Megumi looked at each other. They were always making fun of me.
yMegumiz Same as ever, Yuichi.
They look at each other and giggle.
yMegumiz Mr. Yuichi, that's how she called you right? How sweet. But I am sorry for her...
yYuichiz Why?
yKyoukoz Ms. Matsuno will have more pain.
Megumi sighed as she looked in the direction Hiromi left.
yKyoukoz Some women use men to become better women. Maybe this was true for her.
yMegumiz Yeah, Yuichi is just a step on the ladder we are all climbing.
yYuichiz Hey!
How can they say that?
They didn't care.
yMegumiz You still have lipstick on your lips.
She touched her own lips to show me where the lipstick was.
yYuichiz Really?
I wiped my lips with my hand. There was no lipstick on it.
When I looked up, both of them were laughing at me. I just can't stand it...
