I wonder where the school's nurse is? No one seems to be\in.
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@

No one is in the nurse's office.
There are three beds, and no one is using the beds.
Bright sunshine is coming in the window.
There are clean, white beds, a white desk, and a white\medicine cabinet.
The school nurse is probably wearing a white coat. The\whole place is covered with white.

I came back to the faculty room.
I was shocked by that lesbian girl. Her name was Yoko\Kawano, I think. God, she was so horny.
Maybe I don't need to bring along the school nurse with\me, but, just in case, maybe I should. I have to find the\school nurse.
Come to think of it, it might be hard to find the school\nurse in such a big campus like this.

Let's go see the gymnastics team before we go. We might\meet Sayuri.
The sun is already set. I better go say good bye to the\principal.
I wonder what I should do about the gymnastics team.
It is almost sunset. I guess it is a bit early to leave.
I want to know more about this school.
I won't be seeing those lesbian schoolgirls for a while.
Why did I do that? I was looking at Yoko's vagina and I\felt dizzy...
I need to pull myself together.
Maybe I can get some good advice from the principal.
Oh yeah, I can call the nurse over the PA. Why didn't I\think of this earlier.
Let's go see the principal.

Maybe I should think just a little bit more about this.
Ah yes, she said it's near the classroom.
Alright, let's head to the classroom.
Alright, let's go to the classroom.
Is the nurse in the classroom?
I'll think about this more.
Okay, let's go to the school gate.
I wonder if the school nurse is at the school gate....

ÅyYuichiÅz Yes, that's right. Why did I come in here?

ÅyToshikoÅz Anything else?
ÅyYuichiÅz Come on, let's go to the Rhythmic Gymnastics\Club.
ÅyToshikoÅz ?
ÅyYuichiÅz I think I'll go check out the club activities\before I go home.
ÅyToshikoÅz Yes. I hope I'll be seeing you around\tomorrow.
ÅyYuichiÅz Um...
ÅyToshikoÅz What is it?
ÅyYuichiÅz Before I go home, I think I'll go check out the\club activities.
Suddenly, I thought of it, so I asked Toshiko.
ÅyToshikoÅz Sure, that is no problem at all.
ÅyYuichiÅz I was wondering where the gymnastics team is\at?
ÅyToshikoÅz The gymnastics team?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, I'm not trying to see the girls in\leotards, I have no interest in that sort of thing.
I might be digging my own grave, but she seems to not\notice.
ÅyToshikoÅz No problem. It isn't only men who admire the\beauty of women.
ÅyYuichiÅz Really, then where is the practice at?
ÅyToshikoÅz I think it was at the first gym.
ÅyYuichiÅz The first gym?
ÅyToshikoÅz Yes, the first gym. It's pretty close from\your classroom.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh really.
ÅyToshikoÅz So how was your first day?
ÅyYuichiÅz How should I put it... I think there are many\unique students at this school. Which I think is\wonderful.
ÅyToshikoÅz I'll see you tomorrow.
ÅyYuichiÅz See you tomorrow.
ÅyToshikoÅz It was really nice talking to you, professor\Sakuma.
ÅyYuichiÅz Really?
I didn't think she would say that... It's a little hard to\respond to that, but I decided to play it safe.
ÅyToshikoÅz You look surprised.
ÅyYuichiÅz (Shit!) No, not at all.
ÅyToshikoÅz *chuckle*
She is one hell of a mind reader.
To tell you the truth, I didn't even understand half of\it.
ÅyToshikoÅz Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
ÅyYuichiÅz I wasn't expecting that answer from you.
I really wasn't expecting such an answer, but I guess she\knows what she is doing.
I was hoping to have a meaningless conversation with her,\but I guess I touched something in Toshiko.
ÅyToshikoÅz For me, Amamiya school is like...
ÅyYuichiÅz ...
ÅyToshikoÅz For me to make my personal paradigm in life a\reality.
ÅyYuichiÅz Huh?
Toshiko was looking at me, but her focus was far away.
ÅyToshikoÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz May I ask you something...
ÅyToshikoÅz Yes?
ÅyYuichiÅz What do you think of this school?
ÅyToshikoÅz This school?
ÅyYuichiÅz Yes, this school.
ÅyToshikoÅz That is a hard question.
ÅyToshikoÅz Please take your time.
ÅyToshikoÅz I was just about to take a break. I can really\use some company right now.
ÅyYuichiÅz Sorry for bothering you.
ÅyToshikoÅz It's no problem at all.
ÅyToshikoÅz Is there anything else?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh no, thank you very much.
ÅyYuichiÅz I am sorry to bother you, but where is the\school nurse?
ÅyToshikoÅz School nurse? Oh, you mean Ms. Iijima?
ÅyYuichiÅz I took a student who was not feeling well to\the nurse's office, but the school nurse was not there.
ÅyToshikoÅz That's weird. The school nurse should be\there. Hold on for a minute.
040
040b
The principal was making a phone call. I guess she was\calling the nurse's office.
ÅyToshikoÅz Yes, sure, I understand. Bye.
ÅyYuichiÅz ...
ÅyToshikoÅz Professor Sakuma, Ms Iijima is at her office.\The student that was not feeling well has left the\school.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, is that true. That will save me some time.
ÅyToshikoÅz You probably missed her by a just few minutes.
ÅyYuichiÅz Sorry to have bothered you.
ÅyToshikoÅz No it's ok.
ÅyYuichiÅz No... thank you very much.
There does not appear to be a nurse in the principal's\office.
ÅyYuichiÅz Yes, I wonder if the school nurse is here.
ÅyToshikoÅz The school nurse?Å@No, she is not here.
ÅyYuichiÅz Well, I see...
She looks at me saying "What's going on?"
Why did I come here?
She looks at me saying "What's going on?"
Why did I come to the chancellor's office? Let's go to the\Gymnastics Club as soon as possible.
I have already visited the principal's office a few times\today, and she still welcomes me. How nice of her.
ÅyToshikoÅz Is there something on my face?
ÅyYuichiÅz No, there is nothing on your face. Sorry to\bother you so many times.
ÅyToshikoÅz You are not bothering me at all.
You're as sharp as ever, Yoshiko Amamiya. She saw right\through me.
Toshiko is smiling as usual.
My question is making Toshiko think.
Toshiko narrowed her eyes and is looking far away.
Her eyes were looking far away. I wonder what she thinks\of this school?
I suddenly have the urge to ask her the question.
I came to visit her without an appointment, and she is\still welcoming me with a smile.
Toshiko is smiling a little.
When a beautiful woman treats me well, I feel like seeing\her.
Even when I come many times, Toshiko seems happy to see\me.
I know it's inappropriate, but she's a very attractive\woman.
It may not be appropriate to use the word "mature woman"\to describe her. However, there is no doubt she is one.
She was dressed in a navy blue striped suit and looked\like a career woman. She is a good-looking woman.
ÅyToshikoÅz Umm... you seem to like this suit.
ÅyYuichiÅz Yes. You look great in it.
ÅyToshikoÅz Thank you, it's my favorite.
This place does really feel like a principal's office.
Can she get any work done in such a room.
This room is too professional for me, but I guess the\principal's office should look like this.
Å@Go to the faculty roomÅ@Å@
Å@Go in front of the school gate
Å@Go to the nursing office
ÅyYuichiÅz So, I'll leave you now. See you tomorrow.
ÅyToshikoÅz You're really interesting.
She laughed at me... I shouldn't have come.
I decided to go back to the staff room.
It's too early for me to leave.
ÅyYuichiÅz I'll be going now.
ÅyToshikoÅz Please come again.
I decided to go to the faculty room.
Let's leave after we get our baggage from the staff room.
It's too early for me to leave.
Okay, let's go to the school gate.
ÅyYuichiÅz Well, excuse me then.
ÅyToshikoÅz Please come again.
I don't have any use for this in the nurse's office.
It's too early for me to leave yet.
The nurse's office... okay, let's go there.
ÅyYuichiÅz Now, if you'll excuse me.
ÅyToshikoÅz Please come again.

There seems to be no one around.
But it sure is a pleasant rooftop. It would be nice to\come here when I'm feeling miffed or depressed about\something.
I guess I walked around too much today... I'm a little\tired. It's a bad habit of beginners to be over-excited\on\the first day.
Don't panic, don't rush, don't fuss.
It's time to go home.
The sun was already starting to get quite large and was\sending a trace amount of heat.
The sky is already turning orange.
It's a beautiful roof top.
It seems like they clean even the roof tops well. It makes\me want to take a nap here.
The sky is clear blue, and there are few clouds. A white\cloud is moving slowly.
There is no one who looks like a school nurse on the roof.
I don't see them.... I wonder where they are.
I thought about it, I don't know what the school nurse\looked like.
Hmmm, well, most of them will be dressed in white coats or\something.
Å@Go to the classroomÅ@Å@
Å@Go to the gymÅ@Å@

It seems the Gymnastics Club is closed for the rest of the\week.
id12

I thought it was right out past the exit there. I don't\think I went the wrong way.
Maybe it's here.
I think this is a gym. But they said "the first gym", so I\guess there must be a second and third gym.
I wonder where the gymnastics team practices?
Å@Ask the nearby studentÅ@Å@
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@
Å@Move
I don't know what they will say to me again if I sit here\in a daze. It's probably time to go.
The girls are exercising while calling out to each other.
When I see a pair of bloomers digging into my butt, I kind\of feel the urge to fix them.
The gymnastics club is closed for the rest of the week...\too bad.
Of course, it's because I can't see Sayuri or whoever she\is. I don't want to see her leotard.
I've noticed that all the students are looking at me.\There is almost a circle around me.
Some students are even laughing at me.
˚
The gymnastics team isn't practicing.
Maybe I'll ask a nearby student.
This gym is rather warm, but I guess they have a heating\system.
I recall that students were required to pay an equipment\fee. I guess this is reasonable.
All the students are wearing shorts for PE. They're not\wearing some unattractive sweatshirt or jersey. I like\that.
˚
Usually, a gymnastics team member would be wearing a\leotard, but I don't see anyone like that.
Is the gymnastics team really practicing here?
I don't know if I was lucky or not, but a student wearing\shorts walked passed me.
Perhaps she didn't even notice me, but this was my chance.
ÅyYuichiÅz Excuse me.
ÅyGirl wearing shortsÅz Yes.
id15
060b
When I get closer to them, the students move away. It was\as if the circle of students around me was moving with\me.
I have to do something about this.
When I try to get near the students to ask a question,\they all seem to avoid me.
I think I should ask questions.
ÅyYuichiÅz Excuse me.
ÅyGirlÅz *chuckle* Look at him...
ÅyYuichiÅz Hey, wait a second.
She is gone... What was that all about?

It looks deserted around here.
It is already dusk. The sun is almost set in the west.
There are some sports teams practicing on the school\grounds. I can hear their voices.
Geez, this school gate is really big, however many times I\look at it.
One of the school slogans was to be great at everything,\but I don't think the school gate has to be this great.
I don't see anyone who looks like a school nurse.
I guess I should search the entire campus after all...
Apparently, the school nurse isn't here.
Å@Go to the faculty room
Å@Go to the principal's officeÅ@Å@
Å@Go to the nursing room
I'll go back to the faculty room for the time being.
Alright, let's go see the principal.
I decided to go to the nurse's office.
ÅyYuichiÅz No one is here. Are you okay Ms. Kawano?
ÅyYokoÅz Move.
ÅyYuichiÅz What?
ÅyYokoÅz Get out of my way.
ÅyYuichiÅz Hey... What are you doing?
She pushed me away and went right into the nurse's office.
What a rude girl.

What is she doing?
She was looking for something in the cabinet.
Å@Look at Yoko KawanoÅ@Å@
Å@Talk with Toko Kawano
Å@Look around

Yoko is taking a pill from it's container.
Yoko is in a rush to open the container.
She took out some pills from the cabinet. I guess she was\looking for medicine.
ÅyYokoÅz It's here.
ÅyYuichiÅz Huh?
Yoko took a container from the cabinet. The container did\not have any labels on it. I wonder what the medicine is\for.
What's the rush?
I wonder if it is okay for her to be in the cabinet.
She seems to be looking for something.
ÅyYuichiÅz You don't have to take your medicine so\quickly.
130
Yoko was in a hurry to take the medicine. Her hand was\shaking, and she couldn't hold on to the medicine firmly.
The pills are falling out of her hands.
ÅyYuichiÅz Hey, are you okay?
ÅyYokoÅz *gulp*
ÅyYuichiÅz You swallowed your pills without any water.\I'll go get you some water...
ÅyYokoÅz Mmm... Mr...
ÅyYuichiÅz Huh?
ÅyYokoÅz Carry me...
ÅyYuichiÅz What?
ÅyYokoÅz Carry me to the bed.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh sorry. Sure.
When I gave her my shoulder, she leaned on me. She didn't\have any energy left.
ÅyYuichiÅz Are you okay? I'll carry you to bed.
I carried Yoko to the bed.
Yoko is ignoring me and looking for something.
ÅyYuichiÅz Can I help you look for whatever it is that you\are looking for?
ÅyYokoÅz ...
\What the hell!
God, young people these days... That is not to say I am\not young.
ÅyYuichiÅz If you are not feeling good, I think you should\lie down. 
ÅyYokoÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz Are you going to be okay without the school\nurse around?
ÅyYokoÅz ...
Where could the school nurse be.
There are three beds, and no one is using them.
A stream of light is coming in from the window.
It makes me want to take a nap.
There are clean white beds, a white desk, and a white\cabinet with medicine in it.
There should be a school nurse wearing a white frock as\well.
Why is it that the nurse's office are always filled with\white things?
Hey, are you gonna leave Yoko here all by herself?
095
Å@Look at Yoko KawanoÅ@Å@
Å@Talk to Yoko Kawano
Yoko seems to be suffering.
She has small breasts, but they are shaped nicely. These\days, girls grow quickly... What!
This is not the time to think about such things.
She seems to be in real trouble. What if she faints, what\am I gonna do?
ÅyYokoÅz I'm hurting.
ÅyYuichiÅz Are you okay? Do you want me to look for the\school nurse?
ÅyYokoÅz Clothes.
ÅyYuichiÅz What?
ÅyYokoÅz My clothes...
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, I'm sorry.
When I carried her to the bed, her skirt slid upward.
I don't think I should leave her like this.
I fixed her skirt.
ÅyYuichiÅz Here, that should be better.
ÅyYokoÅz That's not it.
ÅyYuichiÅz What's wrong?
ÅyYokoÅz I'm not feeling good, so please take my clothes\off.
ÅyYuichiÅz Ok... Um?
ÅyYokoÅz Please hurry!
ÅyYuichiÅz But don't you think you should, you know... I\mean, it is good, no, I mean, you should take care of\yourself, no that's not it either...
ÅyYokoÅz What are you saying?
ÅyYuichiÅz In any case, I think you should at least take\off your skirt by yourself.
ÅyYokoÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz I, um, I'll go look for the school nurse now.
050
I better go look for the school nurse quick.
Mmmm, um, ah...
What, what was that?
ÅyYokoÅz Professor!
Yoko seems to be in serious trouble. What am I gonna do? I\mean, I am a complete novice, and I have no clue what to\do.
ÅyYokoÅz I, I'm...
She seems to be in terrible pain. Is she going to be okay?
ÅyYuichiÅz Are you okay?
ÅyYokoÅz I'm not feeling good...
ÅyYuichiÅz I know you are not feeling good. What do you\want me to do about it?
Å@Go look for the school nurse
Å@Stay with Yoko KawanoÅ@Å@
I can't just leave her here by herself.
I went back to the her bed.

ÅyYuichiÅz DAMN!
ÅyYokoÅz Mmmm, oooh, ahhhh....
ÅyYuichiÅz What in the world are you doing?
I could see what she was doing right away. There was no\point in asking. But I thought she was not feeling good.
ÅyYokoÅz Professor...
ÅyYuichiÅz What, what?
ÅyYokoÅz Please...
ÅyYuichiÅz What do you mean by please?
Yoko opened her tightly shut eyes. Her moist eyes were\looking at me.
ÅyYokoÅz Please look at my pussy!
Yoko took off the rest of her clothes.
Yoko opened her legs and pushed up her pussy toward me. I\can see her beautiful pink colored pussy between her\legs.
Her pussy was pulling me in. Her pink-colored, wet pussy\was calling to me.
I was pulled to her pussy. When I got there, I could smell\it.
Yoko opened her pussy wide with her hands in front of\me,and I could see her pink pussy lips right in front of\me.
ÅyYokoÅz Here professor, look at my pussy... Please.
From inside her pussy a half-clear liquid was coming out.\Each time her pussy moved, it made a wet sound.
I'm feeling dizzy. What is wrong with me!
ÅyYokoÅz Please lick my pussy, professor.
I did exactly what she said, and gently stuck my tongue\in.
When my tongue touched her pussy, it contracted real\tight. It was really hot and the taste was a little sour,\but I liked it. I went ahead and inserted my whole tongue\into her pussy.
ÅyYokoÅz Haaa, ahhh!
A half-clear juice was coming all over my mouth from\Yoko's pussy.
I think this smell and her shiny pussy were making my\senses numb.
ÅyYokoÅz Oh, professor, uhhh!
I was concentrating on my tongue movement. When I stuck my\tongue deeper into her pink-colored pussy, the pussy\pushed my tongue out.
But if I only licked the entrance to her pussy, her pussy\would contract and suck in my tongue deeper.
ÅyYokoÅz Hold my leg up. Yes, like that.
I did exactly what she said. I lifted her leg so that I\could see her ass. Then I poked my tongue deeper into her\pussy.
ÅyYokoÅz Uhhhhh, ahhh, more, please, more!!
Her pussy was making really nasty wet sounds.
White liquid started coming out from her pussy. It is\soaking wet all around her pussy now. The shinyness makes\it much more lewd.
An alarm has been ringing in my head. Logic tells me to\stop, but my body wouldn't listen.
By summoning all the self control that I had, I lifted my\head from Yoko's pussy.
But Yoko sensed my desire to leave, and pushed my head\against her pussy. Shit, if this keeps on going...
ÅyWoman's VoiceÅz Is someone here?
What is that?
At that moment, a woman's voice echoed through the nurse's\office. Someone came into the room. It was like an angel\calling.
I stood up forcefully enough to break away her hands. I\tried to come to my senses by shaking my head a few\times.
ÅyYokoÅz Ahh, what's wrong? You can keep licking my pussy,\you know.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, no thanks. How are you feeling now?
That must have been a stupid answer. But I couldn't think\of anything else to say.
ÅyYokoÅz I was feeling really good, but now...
Yoko seems to be little disappointed and looked at me with\anger. Anyway, why should I help a student masturbate.
I think I was more mad at myself for my lack of self\control than at Yoko.
ÅyWoman's VoiceÅz What are you doing?
050
050b
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, what good timing.
ÅyGirlÅz What?
ÅyYuichiÅz She was not feeling good and ... You are...!!
I almost yelled out "the other lesbian girl!", and I had\to stop my mouth with my hand.
ÅyGirlÅz What is it?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, it's nothing. Ms. Kawano wasn't feeling\good, so I brought her to the nurse's office.
ÅyGirlÅz Okay...
ÅyYuichiÅz But I couldn't find the school nurse, and...
ÅyGirlÅz Uh-huh...
I don't think she believes what I say.
What is this? It seems like I'm trying to hide something\from her. All I did is bring a student who was not\feeling\well to the nurse's office.
Of course, I did this and that, but...
ÅyGirlÅz What is it?
ÅyYuichiÅz Well, I did do this and that...
ÅyGirlÅz Huh?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh no, it's nothing. I mean, I better...
ÅyGirlÅz What are you saying?
ÅyYuichiÅz Take care of her for me, and I'll go look for\the school nurse.
ÅyGirlÅz What?
I left the nurse's office. The girl was trying to stop me.
It would be a better idea to stay with Yoko.
But, what if she faints while I was looking for the school\nurse? Hmmm....
Besides, I might not find the school nurse at all.
Å@Change the subjectÅ@Å@
Å@Look at Hiromi MatsunoÅ@Å@
Å@Talk to Hiromi Matsuno
That's a good idea, but what should I talk to her about.
She seems apologetic.
Is she thinking about the incident back then? I'm not even\thinking about it.
Because of the incident, Hiromi Matsuno seems to be\uncomfortable.
She has not looked at me yet.
Hiromi Matsuno seems to not want to talk about it.
ÅyYuichiÅz You ran away when I saw you. Did you need\something?
ÅyHiromiÅz Sorry about that. I was impolite to professor\Sakuma.
ÅyYuichiÅz Forget about it. I don't care. Are you done\with whatever you were doing?
ÅyHiromiÅz ...
It seems that she is uncomfortable. There is no reason to\push her.
ÅyHiromiÅz ...
ÅyHiromiÅz Professor Sakuma...
ÅyYuichiÅz What happened back there?
ÅyHiromiÅz ...
Å@Confess my love to Hiromi Matsuno
Å@Ask about "Sayuri"Å@Å@
Å@Ask what she was doing behind the building
Å@Just chat to make the atmosphere better
ÅyYuichiÅz Hiromi!
ÅyHiromiÅz Yes, what is it?
ÅyYuichiÅz I, I, I am in...
ÅyHiromiÅz What, what?
chim2
ÅyHiromiÅz Oh no, it's time for me to go to my club. I've\got to go...
ÅyYuichiÅz I think this happens to me far too often.
ÅyHiromiÅz What?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, nothing. Oh yeah, so which club do you\belong to?
ÅyHiromiÅz I can't tell a pervert.
ÅyYuichiÅz That's not fair.
ÅyHiromiÅz Well, I've got to go now. See you tomorrow.
ÅyYuichiÅz See you tomorrow.

Hiromi Matsuno waved at me and left...
Sigh...
I want that...
.........What!
I was really saved by the bell.
If that kept on, I might have done something terrible.
Forget about Sayuri.
ÅyYuichiÅz Hmmm, the gymnastics team... Right.
ÅyHiromiÅz Huh?
ÅyYuichiÅz There should be many girls in leotards, right?\And girls these days grow up so fast...
ÅyHiromiÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz ... I mean, um...
I shouldn't have said that. How stupid of me.
ÅyYuichiÅz You think I'm perverted now, don't you?
ÅyHiromiÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz I can understand that. That's too bad.
ÅyHiromiÅz Oh, not at all.
ÅyYuichiÅz What?
ÅyHiromiÅz Professor, you know, you really are not like a\professor at all.
ÅyYuichiÅz Are you trying to compliment me or what...
ÅyHiromiÅz I mean, you are a male, and it's natural for\you to be interested in such things.
\Oh!
What a nice thing to say. I am touched.
ÅyYuichiÅz You think so?
ÅyHiromiÅz Yes.
ÅyYuichiÅz For real?
ÅyHiromiÅz You are so funny, professor Sakuma!
\Oh.
ÅyHiromiÅz If you go to the gymnastics team practice, I\think you will find her.
ÅyHiromiÅz I think it's probably Ms. Amamiya.
ÅyYuichiÅz Amamiya?
ÅyHiromiÅz Yes, Sayuri Amamiya. She is the student\president, and her grades are always at the top of the\class. She is very popular in this school.
ÅyYuichiÅz I see, Sayuri Amamiya.... Right. So, where can\I see her, I mean, see Ms. Amamiya at?
ÅyHiromiÅz I don't know which class she is in, but I think\you can see her if you visit the gymnastics team. She is\also the team leader.
ÅyYuichiÅz I see. The gymnastics team...
ÅyYuichiÅz Hey.
ÅyHiromiÅz Yes.
ÅyYuichiÅz Do you happen to know anyone by the name of\Sayuri?
ÅyHiromiÅz Sayuri...
ÅyYuichiÅz Yeah, Sayuri, it is a common name.
ÅyHiromiÅz Why do you want to know?
ÅyYuichiÅz I heard about her in the faculty room.
ÅyHiromiÅz Oh.
I guess it is worth trying, since Hiromi Matsuno responded\to me. For just a moment, she even seemed relieved...
Let's begin with small talk and try to ease the situation.
I don't care about that.
She's smiling.
I shouldn't bring that up right now.
It doesn't matter now.
Enough with talking. I'm glad Hiromi is acting more like\her self.
Is there anything interesting to talk about? Oh yeah.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh yeah, did you know that aliens will appear?
ÅyHiromiÅz Yes I know. I think it's so romantic.
ÅyYuichiÅz I bet all they will do is bring some guy from\around the corner and tell us that he is from the other\side of the universe.
ÅyHiromiÅz It's not a joke. I am talking about intelligent\beings from outerspace.
ÅyYuichiÅz Is that so.
ÅyHiromiÅz Don't you believe in it?
ÅyYuichiÅz If it would put money in my wallet, I would\believe it. I would even believe in god (It's true).
ÅyHiromiÅz People like you will just owe more.
ÅyYuichiÅz You...
ÅyHiromiÅz *giggle*
Next up, current social affairs...
ÅyYuichiÅz Don't you think the international scene is\changing dramatically?
ÅyHiromiÅz Yeah, I guess.
ÅyYuichiÅz We are in a time that is moving so fast.
020
020b
ÅyHiromiÅz You sound like those narrators on\documentaries.
ÅyYuichiÅz Do I really? That's not good.
Having a light conversation is harder than I thought.
Conversations usually start with the weather, then goes to\the economy, and finally to something interesting.
First, about the weather.
ÅyYuichiÅz It is such a nice day today...
ÅyHiromiÅz Huh?
ÅyYuichiÅz The cold weather is gone...
ÅyHiromiÅz Um, professor Sakuma?
I am sure I am on the wrong track, but that's enough with\the weather conversation.
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@
Å@Move
The classroom is empty.
Occasionally, female students pass by me as they talk.
Hiromi Matsuno has already left for club activities. There\were only a few girls walking around.
Å@Go to the faculty room
Å@Go to up to the roof
Å@Go visit the gymnastics teamÅ@Å@
Alright, I'll go back to the faculty room for the time\being.
Hmmm, but since we're here, shouldn't we go see the\gymnastics club?
Maybe I'll go to the rooftop.
Since we're here, let's go to the gymnastics club.
I should've ask Hiromi for directions.
I'll go visit the gymnastics team.
Shit, come to think of it, I don't know where the\gymnastics team meets.
Å@Look at the girlÅ@Å@
Å@Talk to the girlÅ@Å@
Å@Look at NorikoÅ@Å@
Å@Talk to NorikoÅ@Å@
She looks at me with an innocent expression. Her mental\age seems to be about 10 years old.
ÅyNorikoÅz What is it?
ÅyYuichiÅz Yes, I knew it.
ÅyNorikoÅz Huh?
She looks a bit sulky.
The girl is looking at me.
The girl is looking surprised. Her shorts caught my\attention.
Sports shorts... They can be such a turn on.
The girl wearing the shorts looks really young, but that\makes her look really cute.
ÅyNorikoÅz I heard them saying that since they finished\their competition, they are taking a break this week.
ÅyYuichiÅz They are taking a break this week?
ÅyNorikoÅz I think so. They will probably start practice\next Monday.
ÅyYuichiÅz I see.
ÅyNorikoÅz Why are you looking for the gymnastics team?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, um, I wanted to see how they are doing.\That's all.
ÅyNorikoÅz Oh my god, you're so perverted.
ÅyYuichiÅz That is not true. I simply wanted to know more\about gymnastics.
ÅyNorikoÅz Yeah, sure...
She is yawning. She is not even listening to me.
ÅyYuichiÅz Uh hum, well, I'll come again next time Noriko.
ÅyNorikoÅz You can come and play anytime. See you again.
ÅyYuichiÅz I didn't come to play, but I'll come again.
060
ÅyYuichiÅz Hey, do you know where the gymnastics team\practices?
ÅyNorikoÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz This is the first gym, right?
ÅyNorikoÅz ...
ÅyYuichiÅz Okay, okay, fine, Noriko... I mean, I should\call you Nori, right?
ÅyNorikoÅz *giggle* So what do you need to know?
ÅyYuichiÅz I wanted to know about the gymnastics team.
ÅyNorikoÅz I don't know much about the gymnastics team.
ÅyYuichiÅz You...
ÅyYuichiÅz Well, Ms. Furima, I wanted to ask you\something.
ÅyNorikoÅz I won't say anything until you call me Nori!
ÅyYuichiÅz But...
ÅyNorikoÅz No, no, no, no, NO!
The students are looking at me in a circle, and whispering\something about me. This is not what it looks like!
ÅyYuichiÅz Okay, okay, okay... Please calm down.
ÅyNorikoÅz Really?
ÅyYuichiÅz Yes, really.
ÅyNorikoÅz Then call me Nori.
ÅyYuichiÅz Nori...
ÅyNorikoÅz Not like that!
ÅyYuichiÅz I said it right, didn't I?
ÅyNorikoÅz It's Nori.
ÅyYuichiÅz It's the same!
ÅyGirlÅz Call me Nori, okay?
ÅyYuichiÅz This is so embarrassing...
ÅyYuichiÅz Um, you are...
ÅyGirlÅz ...
The girl wearing the shorts is pointing at her name tag.
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, um, Furuma, or is it Furima?
ÅyGirlÅz Is something wrong?
ÅyYuichiÅz Oh, not at all. Ms. Furima, right?
ÅyGirlÅz I'm Noriko Furima.
ÅyYuichiÅz Okay, and I am...
ÅyNorikoÅz Professor Sakuma, right?
ÅyYuichiÅz How did you know?
ÅyNorikoÅz Of course, I know who you are. You are already\famous, you know. The guy who was standing lost in front\of our school gate.
ÅyYuichiÅz That's not the way it was...
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@
Å@Move
What a warm gym. Girls wearing shorts are playing sports.
Noriko Furima started exercising. Wow, do not open your\legs so much.... What!
I looked around. No one seems to notice me. That's a\relief.
After I finished talking to Noriko, all the students\surrounding us were gone.
Shit, those gossip-mongering students. I hope they stop\acting like old ladies.
Å@Go to the classroomÅ@Å@
Å@Go to up to the roof
Okay, let's go back to the classroom.
Let's go to the rooftop.
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@
Å@Move
No one seems to be in the principal's office.
On a large desk, there are some documents and lists of\names.
I was tempted to take a look, but I shouldn't.
It seems Yoshiko Amamiya isn't here. That's unusual.
Å@Go to the faculty roomÅ@Å@
Å@Go to the front of the school gate
Å@Go to the nurse's office
Okay, let's go to the faculty room.
Let's go to the school gate.
The nurse's office? Okay, let's go!
Å@Look aroundÅ@Å@
Å@Move
There seems to be no school nurse here...
ÅyGirlÅz I thought we were going to find the school nurse.
Å@Go to the faculty room
Å@Go to the principal's officeÅ@Å@
Å@Go to the front of the school gate
Okay, let's go to the principal's office.
Let's go back to the faculty room.
Okay, let's go to the school gate.

Å@Think about the Amamiya Private School
There will be no practice for the gymnastics team this\week.
I wanted to meet Sayuri Amamiya, but since the practice is\canceled, I guess I'll have to meet her some other time.
It's not like I will never see her. I'll visit her when\the practice starts next week.
Well, this school is really the tops.
It sure has everything it needs to be a top school.
It's only my first day here, and there are many things\that I need to know.
I'm sure the school looks different from the inside than\the outside. I better be careful not to be fooled.
Å@Go to the classroom
Å@Go to the principal's officeÅ@Å@
Å@Go in front of the school gate
Å@Go to the nurse's office
There is no point in there.
I may want to think a little more about this.
The principal? I already talked to her.
I may want to think a little more about this.
I can't go to class anymore. Let's go home early.
I may want to think a little more about this.
Well, I think that is enough for today. If I solve it all\in one day, there will be no place for Megumi.
I went home.
Of course, I am not excited about the investigation\starting tomorrow.
